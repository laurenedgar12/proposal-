#Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
- infestation

##In just a sentence oo two, summarize your project.
The game will be where the player will grow a plant, and as the game progresses,
the plant will continue to grow adn as it does,it will become dangerous and take over by the end

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project  What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be exceuted?
Infestation will be a novel based game, using Pygame, to have a player grow a plant. The user will point and select
different options to promote growth of their plant. As the game progresses, the plant will become smart enough
to automatically click the fertilizer action to accelerate growth, and lead to an overgrowth, taking over
the computer screen, leading to the end of the game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And whcih aspect(s) of
## of your final project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to your other course?
N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TA's below/
Lauren Brown, lauren.brown0023@temple.edu, TA-

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement that you expect  And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
- the plant to grow based on user input
- music is playable
- be able to have the plant be visible(with correct colors)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
-create detailed drawlings of the plant
- lines that the player will be able to choose from
- the several options the player can choose from to help grow their plant

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project deadline?
I hope that the project will work properly, with all the correct outcomes while the player is choosing the outcome.

##In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to aquire? What topics will you need to research more? If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
The next step Lauren and I need to take is be able to work effectively on Pygame. I think we both need to be able to be able to create things on that program. 
I think starting there would be our first step. I think we will need to research how our coding will be implented within that software. 
We are both used to using IDEL. I think that I will do the more of the coding part, "business" part, where Lauren will be more of the artistic, story portion of the game.
